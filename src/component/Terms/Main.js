                            <h3>Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
                            <p>
                                This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is
                                referred to in this Terms of Service as the Arbitration
                                Agreement. You agree that any and all disputes or claims that
                                have arisen or may arise between you and FloatEV, whether
                                arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service (including
                                any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any advertising, any
                                aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be
                                resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration,
                                rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this
                                Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual
                                claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further,
                                this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing
                                issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies,
                                and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us
                                on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of
                                Service, you and FloatEV are each waiving the right to a trial
                                by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be
                                determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The
                                Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
                                enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

                                seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified
                                mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to
                                FloatEV should be sent to 1070 Cresta Way, Unit 2, San Rafael,
                                CA 94903 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (i) describe the
                                nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the
                                specific relief sought. If FloatEV and you do not resolve the

                                received, you or FloatEV may commence an arbitration proceeding.
                                During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made
                                by FloatEV or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until
                                after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you
                                or FloatEV is entitled.

                            <p>
                                Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in
                                accordance with the American Arbitration Associations (AAA)
                                rules and procedures, including the AAAs Consumer Arbitration
                                Rules (collectively, the AAA Rules), as modified by this
                                Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit
                                its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules
                                and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAAs consumer
                                arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration. If
                                there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and
                                any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of
                                this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator
                                determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration
                                Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair
                                arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of
                                these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the
                                arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues
                                relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
                                Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are
                                usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other
                                judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages
                                and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an
                                individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law.
                                Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be
                                overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Unless FloatEV and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings
                                will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both
                                parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and
                                other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to
                                agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If
                                your claim is for $10,000 or less, FloatEV agrees that you may
                                choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the
                                basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a
                                telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by
                                the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a
                                hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the
                                manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator
                                shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain
                                the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is
                                based.

                                If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your
                                request, FloatEV will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of
                                relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to
                                demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable
                                to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator
                                otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be
                                required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, FloatEV
                                will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you
                                demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will
                                be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, FloatEV
                                will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems
                                necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
                                cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys fees will be governed
                                by the AAA Rules.

                                Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity

                                be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. FloatEV
                                may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue
                                providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without
                                notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the
                                Service under any provision of this Terms of Service may be
                                effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that
                                FloatEV may immediately deactivate or delete your account and
                                all related information and files in your account and/or bar any
                                further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree
                                that FloatEV will not be liable to you or any third party for
                                any termination of your access to the Service.

                                These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between
                                you and FloatEV and govern your use of the Service, superseding
                                any prior agreements between you and FloatEV with respect to the
                                Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and
                                conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third-party
                                services, third-party content or third party software. These
                                Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of
                                California without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
                                With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to
                                arbitration, as set forth above, you and FloatEV agree to submit
                                to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and
                                federal courts located within San Francisco County, California.
                                The failure of FloatEV to exercise or enforce any right or
                                provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver
                                of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of
                                Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
                                invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should
                                endeavor to give effect to the parties intentions as reflected
                                in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of
                                Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that
                                regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or
                                cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service
                                or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year
                                after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
                                A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in
                                electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative
                                proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same
                                extent and subject to the same conditions as other business

                                printed form. You may not assign this Terms of Service without
                                the prior written consent of FloatEV, but FloatEV may assign or
                                transfer this Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without
